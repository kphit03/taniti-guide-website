                    <h1>Getting to Taniti</h1>
                    <p>
                        Almost all visitors arrive in Taniti by air, though some arrive on a small cruise ship that 
                        docks in Yellow Leaf Bay for one night per week. Taniti is served by a small airport that 
                        accommodates small jets and propeller planes. Expansion plans are underway to enable larger 
                        jets to land on the island in the coming years.
